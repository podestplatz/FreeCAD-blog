This is a daily updated log of the work I do on the `BCF-plugin`_ for FreeCAD

**June 9th:** In `commit 2afab2d`_ I implemented half of `XMLName`_ interface
for all classes. This interface defines a property `xmlName` that each class
inherits. By default this property is set to the name of the class, but the
constructor of `XMLName`_ also offers the possibility to define a custom name
(this is needed for the writer module). Second to the `xmlName` property it
defines a member function `XMLName.getEtElement(element)`_ that shall receive an
`xml.etree.ElementTree.Element` object and shall extend it with its properties,
and return it again. It is expected that the returned element is schema conform
and can be inserted as it is. 

`commit e013043`_ finally removed `SchemaConstraint` and its decendants, since
it was actually unnecessary.

`commit 3eeb7f8`_ added to the writer the functionality of adding objects of
type comment into the corresponding `markup.bcf` file.

**June 8th:** I have worked on the `writer.addElement()` method. All work is
still local and not finished. The overall strategy for the writer module is to
read in the corresponding XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`_, add the new
elements in this structure and write it to the file again.

**June 7th:** Other than beginning a new blog post about the writer module and
how I envision it, I didn't come to much today. 

**June 6th:** Most work today was organisatorial: had correspondence with
`Matteo Cominetti`_ as well as with Paul Deckers (a Product Specialist at the
BIMcollab Support Team) about the topic of handling non conform schema files.
This topic bugs me! For the writer module I am starting to write, I started a
list that contains the elements that shall be updateable/addable and deleteable,
will be available in a future commit. 
On to the development: `commit d6c6cc5`_ I added an own class for the labels of
a topic. This class (`Labels`) inherits from list and also inherits the
`Hierarchy` interface, that I introduced yesterday. The initialisation of a
`Topic` object is unchanged, in the init function the list of string labels is passed
to the constructor of `Labels`. The inheritance from `Hierarchy` offers the
reader the possibility of easily generating the path that leads down to the
corresponding label element in the XML file. 
`commit de38b48`_ adds the parameter `guid` to the constructor of `Comment`.
Till today I overlooked it, which lead me to a pseudo problem. Without the Guid
of a comment I would have had the problem of uniquely identifying the comment
that shall be updated or deleted by the writer module. Additionally the `commit
de38b48`_ finishes the `writer.getUniqueIdOfListElementInHierarchy()`_ function
that generates the hierarchy of a given element and checks if it contains an
element that only occurs in a list, if that is the case then the unique id of
that list element is returned. 

**June 5th:** Today I finally followed the suggestion of @yorik and replaced my
own code for getting the path to the temporary folder with the python module
`tempfiles`, for more information see `commit 5616fd9`_. `commit ac589c8`_ is a
small one, but with some repercussions. In it I added `_viewpoint` to the
initialization sequence of the `markup.__init__()` function. Without it I
wouldn't have been able to use the property `markup.viewpoint`. The amount the
previous commit was smaller than usual `commit c9f9ea4` is larger. In it I
realized some conceptual stuff, like already implementing three interfaces in
many classes, that will make the writer module easier to write and more
maintainable. For this I added the `./src/interfaces` folder. It is its own
python package, and defines three modules/interfaces (atm): 

- State: represents the state of an object during the plugin lifetime
- Hierarchy: allows an object to know the object it is part of and thereby
  somewhat implementing a doubly linked tree. For example consider an object
  of `Markup`. It probably has one or more objects of type `Comment`. Now each
  comment has a member `containingObject`, which in this case references the
  one object of type `Markup` that references it. 
- Identifiable: allows an object to define a unique Id, if it shall be
  uniquely identifiable. This is intended to be used mainly for objects that
  can occur multiple times. Like for example `Viewpoint`. Here the Id is the
  id defined in the XML file.

But please refer to the commit itself for more information, as it has a rather
extensive commit message, describing the interfaces in more detail. 

Please note: tomorrow I won't be able to do much. I try to throw in between one
and three hours.

**June 4th:** In `commit 0557bcc`_ I fixed the issue where the `Comment`_ s didn't
have a valid `ViewpointReference`_ object after creation. The member
`Comment.viewpoint` should, after creation, hold a reference to a valid
`ViewpointReference` object that was created in `reader.buildMarkup()`. Actually it was not
implemented till today, I just left a TODO note for me.
In `commit 354d2c4`_ I added new testcases, all for testing the results of
`reader.buildViewpoint()`_. `commit 0733b59`_ includes fixes of bugs I became
aware of during testing `reader.buildViewpoint()`_, as well as the
implementation of `__str__()` for some more classes, which helped during
debugging. Then `commit d6cb41c`_ also contains bug fixes and debug prints were
remove, but see more in the commit message. And finally I added the file
`./src/bcf/writer.py`_ with some dictionaries that I will need for the writer
module.

Last but not least one thing I learned today using git: don't rebase onto
master. Rebase master onto some branches but not the other way around. This
makes things messy.

**June 3rd:** A new blog post is ready, this one elaborates a bit on the ideas I
have in regards to handling `non schema conform BCF files`_. The `branch unit_tests`_
got a few new commits, mainly adding test cases for the `reader.buildTopic()`
and `reader.buildComment()` functions, for more info see `commit c94d812`_.
`commit 7a31462`_ contains bug fixes for bugs that I became aware of due to the
newly created test cases. Offline I thought for an extended period of time about
how to structure an update in place approach to writing the bcf file, rather
than writing the whole file at once. For this a new blog post is coming this
week.

**June 2nd:** I have written on a blog post about how to handle non XSD conform
BCF files (which is not finished, yet). Otherwise I paused development.
Tomorrow it is gonna be picked up again!

**June 1st:** Today not much work was done, but here is a little summary. I
implemented the `__eq__()` function in every class I defined, see `commit
0305754`_. This shall help me in the future when I want to write unit tests. 
In `reader.py`_ I inserted a rather long comment about how the `buildX`
functions, like what they do, what they expect and what they return. Since all
behave the same I have written one big comment to document all of them, but see
`commit a05e22b`_. The branch `feature_read_viewpoint`_ got merged into master,
for testing I will create a own testing branch. And I created a package out of
the `src/bcf`_ directory that just exports `reader.py`_ and `writer.py` (latter
one I still have to write), for details see `commit 015c2f6`_.

**May 31st:** Today all work was done on the `feature_read_viewpoint`_-branch.
Most important the function `reader.buildViewpoint()` is finished and with it
the last step was completed to being able to read in a complete BCF file, given
it is validated successful against the XML schemas. For more info see `commit
2922d71`_. To test the reader "module" I created two new topics in
`src/bcf/test_data`. One is complete in the way that it defines at least one
element for every node in all files specified by the corresponding XSD file. The
third topic just has a complete header element in `markup.bcf`. For more info
see `commit 7fa127a`_. Now ViewpointReference has a reference to the
corresponding Viewpoint object. The inheritance approach thrown away because
after reading in all ViewpointReferences from `markup.bcf` the Viewpoint objects
would have been created, but with no relation to their super class. This meant
that an object of the former could not have been used as an object of the latter
without recreation of this object. That further would have complicated the code,
and made it hard to understand and maintain. Therefore composition was chosen in
favor of inheritance. For more info also see `commit 2922d71`_.

**May 30th:** Added the folder `src/bcf/test_data`_ that is intended to contain
test data for testing during development, but not primarily for unit tests now.
Currently it contains an example compliant with the schema files. For more info
see `commit 6fb72f5`_. In `commit 30b998d`_ I changed the type of every variable
associated with `SchemaConstraints` to an elementary type. Reason being that the
`extensions.xsd` file (as my understanding goes) is intended to be specified
in the xml file itself as ... well, an extension to the existing schema.
Finished function `reader.buildMarkup()`_, although still a "#TODO" comment is
above the function header. Also in `commit aa04598`_ the class
`DocumentReference` and `BimSnippet` was added. Last but not least: started
working on reading in `viewpoint.bcfv`. But not finished, that is why this
development is still on the branch `feature_read_viewpoint`_. For more info
refer to `commit 154630d`_.

**May 29th:** Already started refactoring a bit in `reader.py`_. Went away from
using `ZipFile` objects when operating on the zipFile to the extracted version
of the zip file instead. Written function `reader.readInFile()` that shall read
the complete BCF file into the data structure (see `commit 9a79162`_). During testing 
I noticed that the example BCF file from the `bimcollab website`_ is not valid
becaus it defines an empty node `Header` in `markup.bcf` of topic
`ebb1a8bf-6d1d-4aad-a875-61ad3cc40d30` which is prohibited by `markup.xsd` of
BCF version 2.1.

**May 28th:** Created a new blog post about the way the schema constraints are
handled now (`schema constraints revisited`_). Change configuration file of the
blog to reflect the current project, instead of the FreeCAD development blog.
Started a unit-test suite, see `branch unit_tests ./src/tests`_, and test cases
written for `reader.buildProject()`_. Written function in `reader.py` that
parses `bcf.version` and returns the version number as string, see `commit
cccde6a`_

**May 27th:** Complete the python representation of the class diagram `commit
0a1081b`_. Also advanced to the point where a `.bcf` can be opened, every XML
file be validated (in theory, only tested it with project.bcfp yet) and the
contents of `project.bcfp` are can be written to an object of `Project`. For
more details refer to following commits: 

- `commit bae270f`_: Add util.py and reader.py
- `commit 3c0b9d0`_: util.py: add schemaValidate 
- `commit f62ed23`_: reader.py: add buildProject 

**May 26th:** Update Comment in class diagram. For more info see `commit 1c34ad9`_, and create `mockup of the plugin interface`_.
Write part one of the class model in python see `commit 31ef931`_.
