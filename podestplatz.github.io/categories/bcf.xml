contents may not be (in part) conform to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Schemas"&gt;XSDs&lt;/a&gt; supplied by buildingSmart on
github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-is-there-a-need-for-that"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is there a need for that?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, during testing with one of the two BCF files I currently have (here the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.bimcollab.com/Files/Example-Projects/BIMcollab_Example_project_Issues-bcfzip.aspx"&gt;link to the first one&lt;/a&gt; to download) I wanted to validate each file I read in,
before I read it in, to be (mostly) sure that my code does not throw unexpected
exceptions. But already in &lt;cite&gt;markup.bcf&lt;/cite&gt; of the first topic the library I use,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/"&gt;xmlschema&lt;/a&gt;, threw an &lt;cite&gt;XMLSchemaValidatorError&lt;/cite&gt;. The reason was that the node
&lt;cite&gt;&amp;lt;Header /&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt; was defined, but it was defined empty, which is prohibited by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/blob/master/Schemas/markup.xsd"&gt;markup.xsd&lt;/a&gt;. So as quick fix I deleted the &lt;cite&gt;&amp;lt;Header /&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt; node altogether to be
able to test my code somewhat. But now on to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-does-xmlschema-report-parsing-errors"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does &lt;cite&gt;xmlschema&lt;/cite&gt; report parsing errors?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can go into the problem solution, a little investigation of the
library I am using has to be done. We need to know how it handles the nodes and
attributes that could not be parsed/decoded against the corresponding XSD
file.
For parsing/decoding &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/"&gt;xmlschema&lt;/a&gt; defines the following three &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://xmlschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#xsd-validation-modes"&gt;validation
modes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strict&lt;/strong&gt;: Schemas are validated against the meta-schema. The processor stops
when an error is found in a schema or during the validation/decode of XML
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lax&lt;/strong&gt;: Schemas are validated against the meta-schema. The processor collects
the errors and continues, eventually replacing missing parts with wildcards.
Undecodable XML data are replaced with None.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skip&lt;/strong&gt;: Schemas are not validated against the meta-schema. The processor
doesn't collect any error. Undecodable XML data are replaced with the original
text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the ones, like me, that got confused by the first sentence of the first two modes:
every schema that is read in is itself validated against a schema, the
meta-schema, before it can be used. These modes can be used separately for
reading the schema file and for parsing/decoding a XML file. So for example it
is possible to read the &lt;cite&gt;markup.xsd&lt;/cite&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;strict&lt;/strong&gt; mode, thereby validating it
against a meta-schema, but then parsing/decoding the &lt;cite&gt;markup.bcf&lt;/cite&gt; file in
&lt;strong&gt;lax&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;skip&lt;/strong&gt; mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="in-what-way-can-errors-be-handled"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In what way can errors be handled?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the modes in which XML files can be read in by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/"&gt;xmlschema&lt;/a&gt; I could only
think about the following two possibilities on how to handle possible errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just ignore the node that could not be parsed/decoded against the
corresponding schema file. Easy to accomplish with &lt;strong&gt;lax&lt;/strong&gt; mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read in the plain XML text for that node, store it somewhere in the data
structure and when writing it all out again just insert the plain XML text into
the right place. Only possible in &lt;strong&gt;skip&lt;/strong&gt; mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drawback of number 1 is clearly that the data, that couldn't be read
in, would be lost, or only exist in an earlier version of the BCF file, after
the datastructure got written. It would certainly be easy to implement but does
not offer the user great value if his or her data get lost. This is, however, on
the premise of reading in the file once and writing it once after all changes
have been made in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option offers a possibility to circumvent the lost data problem. The
not-parsable elements just get read in plain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there may be another option that could use &lt;strong&gt;lax&lt;/strong&gt; mode without the data
loss. This option is another approach to writing the contents of the
datastructure to the file. Originally I planned to do it in one sweep when the
user presses the enter key or the save button for that matter.  But then
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;amp;u=255"&gt;hardeeprai&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/"&gt;freecad forum&lt;/a&gt; suggested, to another topic, that I
write changes right after the were made. So effectively implementing an update
driven approach to making changes permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now there are two possible approaches to handling errors that each use a
different validation mode. In the next section I want to list some thoughts I
came up with for each one of these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="approaches-pros-cons"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approaches: Pros &amp;amp; Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reading-once-and-writing-once"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reading once and writing once&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already established, &lt;strong&gt;skip&lt;/strong&gt; mode must be used here with &lt;cite&gt;xmlschema&lt;/cite&gt;. For
every member in the data structure it has to be noted somewhere if it could be
read in or not. That would indicate whether the node holds the acutal value of
the intended datatype or if it holds the plain XML text as string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; writing the datastructure is fairly easy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantage #1:&lt;/strong&gt; every class, that represents part of the XML file, has to be
changed in order to house the additional information about every member or a
whole new datastructure has to be created for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantage #2:&lt;/strong&gt; the type annotations become invalid, if this approach is
used, which leads to confusion by the ones reading the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantage #3:&lt;/strong&gt; the module that reads in the XML file into the data model
becomes much more complex, thereby not aiding the understandability of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="updating-the-file-on-the-fly"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Updating the file on the fly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;strong&gt;lax&lt;/strong&gt; mode can be used with &lt;cite&gt;xmlschema&lt;/cite&gt;. Still the whole file has to be
read in once, but the parts that could not be parsed/decoded stay in the file and are
not read in. To really be able to update the original file, the datamodel has to
accommodate information for every element if it is new or updated, and therefore
shall be written or not. The overhead here is comparable to the first approach
but every class just needs one additional member to signify a change or that
this object was newly created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantage #1:&lt;/strong&gt; (as already mentioned) not so much overhead in the data model
compared to the first approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantage #2:&lt;/strong&gt; The user is not exposed to the danger of losing unsaved
changes, since it is updated every time a new change is committed to the data
representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantage #1:&lt;/strong&gt; the module that writes the data to the BCF file has to have
light parsing capabilities or a XML awareness respectively, in order to be able
to edit XML files directly. This does not have to be the case with the first
approach, since we could utilize the &lt;cite&gt;xmlschema&lt;/cite&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantage #2:&lt;/strong&gt; Objects that get deleted must not be deleted right away
from the data model. Rather a flag has to be set that it is "deleted" and the
corresponding part in the file has to be removed as well. After that it can be
removed from the data model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am gravitating more to the latter option, since it does not interfere with the
type annotations, and therefore does not complicate the whole type situation
in the data model. What I still have to face, however, is the XML aware writer
module. This is going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bcf</category><category>schema</category><category>xml</category><guid>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/handling-non-conform-bcf-files/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 07:50:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Learning XSD Syntax</title><link>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/learning-xsd-syntax/</link><dc:creator>Patrick Podest</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway from the XML Schema Definition Tutorial I went through today
was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So the node &lt;cite&gt;&amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt; is part of the definition of a
complex type, it is also called an indicator. What it does is that it tells the
XML checker that the elements specified inside have to occur in the same order
in the XML document to be valid. Also it specifies what elements may be
contained in the complex node.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This greatly improved my understanding of &lt;cite&gt;visinfo.xsd&lt;/cite&gt; which describes how a
&lt;cite&gt;viewpoint.bcfv&lt;/cite&gt; file is built. As I learned during design, the representation
of a viewpoint is almost as complex as the representation of the remaining
contents of a BCF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about how I coudl read the contents of a BCF into this file structure.
As my brain always does, it thinks through the whole process, from checking if
the given file is valid till the point where all the data resides in an object
in memory. This makes me prone to "reinventing the wheel" as I also design a XSD
parser/checker in my head which I then would use to check the given files before
reading them in. But a quick google search brought up a better option, namely an
offical &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/"&gt;python library&lt;/a&gt; for checking XML files against a schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least: I am pleased to announce that the first draft of the class
diagram is ready. You can find it &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/tree/master/doc"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bcf</category><category>bim</category><category>class-diagram</category><category>GSoC</category><guid>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/learning-xsd-syntax/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 04:24:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Advancing to the Viewpoint.bcf part</title><link>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/finishing-up-the-datamodel-uml/</link><dc:creator>Patrick Podest</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=308095#p308095"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, Yorik pointed out that, although part of the
specification, the BimSnippet does not have to be treated with high priority. He
also referred me to Bernd and Duncan in case of questions arising.
As advised, I will consider the BimSnippet in the data model but probably won't
implement it right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progress I made today was mostly in understanding the BCF specification in
regards to the viewpoint.bcfv file. Multiple viewpoint files can be contained
within the folder of one topic. At the beginning of the day I thought that the
data model would be finished rather quick but as it turned out the documentation
on it is not as concise as one might wish it to be. To be more precise: the
whole section about the "Components" element is a bit confusing. It lists
multiple "properties", like &lt;cite&gt;Selection&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Visibility&lt;/cite&gt;. My intuition says that
&lt;cite&gt;Selection&lt;/cite&gt; contains a list of components that are selected, and &lt;cite&gt;Visibility&lt;/cite&gt;
specifies whether these components shall be visible or not. But in reality each
contains a list of components onto which the values of the attributes of the
respective property shall be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit confusing at first, and still is for me. Because of this ambiguity
I decided, for the further data model design, that refer to the related XML
schemas rather than the written documentation. For example here you can find the
schema for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/blob/master/Schemas/visinfo.xsd"&gt;viewpoint.bcf&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the last time I have worked with XML schemas was in vocational school
(I think 2012) I have to refresh my memory on it. For that I will go through the
relevant parts of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp"&gt;W3CSchools: XML Schema Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. Tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bcf</category><category>bim</category><category>class-diagram</category><category>GSoC</category><guid>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/finishing-up-the-datamodel-uml/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2019 03:42:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Representing markup.bcf in UML</title><link>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/representing-markupbcf-in-uml/</link><dc:creator>Patrick Podest</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I mostly finished the UML class diagram in regard to representing the data
of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;markup.bcf&lt;/tt&gt; file. One think I found kind of interesing while creating
the diagram is that in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Documentation"&gt;BCF-XML-Documentation&lt;/a&gt; There is no link between a
topic and a comment, so no id of one is stored in the other. That didn't make
sense at first because I thought that one &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;markup&lt;/tt&gt; could have multiple topics,
which is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However one think what is not that obvious to me is the case with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;BIMSnippet&lt;/tt&gt;.
On the documentation page it says that: "BimSnippet is an additional file containing
information related to one or multiple topics.". This would imply that there
would be more topics inside one &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;markup.bcf&lt;/tt&gt; file, because &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;BimSnippet&lt;/tt&gt; is,
as I understand, also just a node inside &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;markup.bcf&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the open question from the previous post: How to represent constraints
defined in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extensions.xsd&lt;/tt&gt;; I thought about it a little today and came to the
conclusion that it would be the best approach to go with the last option I
listed. That means that for every node, for which constraints are listed in
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extensions.xsd&lt;/tt&gt;, an empty enumeration/class is created which then, during
runtime, gets populated with the valid values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (2019-05-13): The inconsistency is resolved. The BimSnippet node just references one
file that does not have to be inside the topic folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bcf</category><category>bim</category><category>class-diagram</category><category>GSoC</category><guid>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/representing-markupbcf-in-uml/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2019 17:43:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How to represent extension.xsd constraints</title><link>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/how-to-represent-extensionxsd-constraints/</link><dc:creator>Patrick Podest</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So by now this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; exists, which already houses two example BCF files in
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;examples/&lt;/tt&gt;,
supplied by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;amp;u=68"&gt;yorik&lt;/a&gt;. This repository is intended to be the main development repository.
I started a little UML class diagram, which you can find in
the folder &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;doc/&lt;/tt&gt; in the root directory of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note however, the class "Template" is just used for copy and paste. I used it to
set the font to Sourcecode Pro, which was kind of tedious, and since I didn't
know if these font changes translate to newly created classes too I have gone
with the copy&amp;amp;paste approach. The classes presented in this diagram are all for
representing the data from the markup.bcf file (except for the class "Project").
For the creation of these class diagrams I use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dia-installer.de/download/linux.html.de"&gt;Dia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current problem I am facing is: how to represent the constraints given in
the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extension.xsd&lt;/tt&gt; file (a link to it &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Extension%20Schemas"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The most constraints listed in
this file are just listings of valid values for some nodes or attributes. What I
want to do is to force the user of this classes to use one of the valid values
and not have to implement extra code that checks each time the value is set or
written to a file for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what possibilities do I have to choose from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably most intuitively would be to create one enumeration class (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html"&gt;python
reference&lt;/a&gt;) for each attibute or node listed in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extensions.xsd&lt;/tt&gt;. The main
disadvantage her ist that these enumerations have to be maintained by hand, in
the case of a change to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extensions.xsd&lt;/tt&gt;. That makes this first intuitive
option quite unattractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option that comes to mind would be to parse &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extensions.xsd&lt;/tt&gt; and
then programmatically define the enumerations. This is possible due to the
dynamically typed nature of python. However this also implies that the classes,
containing a representation of an affected attribute or node, also have to be
modified every time the plugin starts and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extensions.xsd&lt;/tt&gt; is parsed. This is
because the classes, of which type the class variables are, do not exist before
runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third approach would also be possible where one enumeration class is written,
before runtime, with no values. Then during startup &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extensions.xsd&lt;/tt&gt; gets
parsed and the valid values are added to the enumerations. That however has one
drawback: if the standard gets updated, and a new constraint is put upon another
field then an according class would have to be created manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I still have to think about how it is done best, and what is the most
maintainable version. Already I tend to latter option, because when the standard
changes, most probably also the implementation of this plugin has to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bcf</category><category>bim</category><category>class-diagram</category><category>GSoC</category><guid>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/how-to-represent-extensionxsd-constraints/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 15:54:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>BCF Reference Collection - GSoC 2019 </title><link>https://podestplatz.github.io/FreeCAD-blog/posts/references-to-read/</link><dc:creator>Patrick Podest</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following is a list of all references that were mentioned in the forum.
