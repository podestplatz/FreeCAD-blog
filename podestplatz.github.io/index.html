    <div>
<p>Today I mostly finished the UML class diagram in regard to representing the data
of the <tt class="docutils literal">markup.bcf</tt> file. One think I found kind of interesing while creating
the diagram is that in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Documentation">BCF-XML-Documentation</a> There is no link between a
topic and a comment, so no id of one is stored in the other. That didn't make
sense at first because I thought that one <tt class="docutils literal">markup</tt> could have multiple topics,
which is <strong>not</strong> the case.</p>
<p>However one think what is not that obvious to me is the case with the <tt class="docutils literal">BIMSnippet</tt>.
On the documentation page it says that: "BimSnippet is an additional file containing
information related to one or multiple topics.". This would imply that there
would be more topics inside one <tt class="docutils literal">markup.bcf</tt> file, because <tt class="docutils literal">BimSnippet</tt> is,
as I understand, also just a node inside <tt class="docutils literal">markup.bcf</tt>.</p>
<p>Regarding the open question from the previous post: How to represent constraints
defined in <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>; I thought about it a little today and came to the
conclusion that it would be the best approach to go with the last option I
listed. That means that for every node, for which constraints are listed in
<tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>, an empty enumeration/class is created which then, during
runtime, gets populated with the valid values.</p>
<p>UPDATE (2019-05-13): The inconsistency is resolved. The BimSnippet node just references one
file that does not have to be inside the topic folder.</p>

<p>So by now this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD">repository</a> exists, which already houses two example BCF files in
<tt class="docutils literal">examples/</tt>,
supplied by <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=68">yorik</a>. This repository is intended to be the main development repository.
I started a little UML class diagram, which you can find in
the folder <tt class="docutils literal">doc/</tt> in the root directory of the repository.</p>
<p>Note however, the class "Template" is just used for copy and paste. I used it to
set the font to Sourcecode Pro, which was kind of tedious, and since I didn't
know if these font changes translate to newly created classes too I have gone
with the copy&amp;paste approach. The classes presented in this diagram are all for
representing the data from the markup.bcf file (except for the class "Project").
For the creation of these class diagrams I use <a class="reference external" href="http://dia-installer.de/download/linux.html.de">Dia</a>.</p>
<p>The current problem I am facing is: how to represent the constraints given in
the <tt class="docutils literal">extension.xsd</tt> file (a link to it <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Extension%20Schemas">here</a>). The most constraints listed in
this file are just listings of valid values for some nodes or attributes. What I
want to do is to force the user of this classes to use one of the valid values
and not have to implement extra code that checks each time the value is set or
written to a file for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>So what possibilities do I have to choose from?</strong></p>
<p>Probably most intuitively would be to create one enumeration class (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html">python
reference</a>) for each attibute or node listed in <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>. The main
disadvantage her ist that these enumerations have to be maintained by hand, in
the case of a change to <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>. That makes this first intuitive
option quite unattractive.</p>
<p>The second option that comes to mind would be to parse <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt> and
then programmatically define the enumerations. This is possible due to the
dynamically typed nature of python. However this also implies that the classes,
containing a representation of an affected attribute or node, also have to be
modified every time the plugin starts and <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt> is parsed. This is
because the classes, of which type the class variables are, do not exist before
runtime.</p>
<p>A third approach would also be possible where one enumeration class is written,
before runtime, with no values. Then during startup <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt> gets
parsed and the valid values are added to the enumerations. That however has one
drawback: if the standard gets updated, and a new constraint is put upon another
field then an according class would have to be created manually.</p>
<p>In the end I still have to think about how it is done best, and what is the most
maintainable version. Already I tend to latter option, because when the standard
changes, most probably also the implementation of this plugin has to change.</p>

<p>Following is a list of all references that were mentioned in the forum. I split
them into two categories (for now): Documentation, Implementation Reference. In
former category standards and definitions are to be found (e.g.: BCF-XML
Documentation). The category "Implementation Reference" shall hold links to
examples, tutorials etc.</p>
<p>This list of references is most likely to grow over time.</p>

<p>Greetings to all FreeCADers, this post is created by a FreeCAD volunteer to keep the community up to date about how 0.18 development is progressing. Since FreeCAD has a pretty long release cycle (the team has decided on a yearly cycle)
this blog then will come in handy for folks that are really wanting to use the vibrant and prolific bleeding-edge of FreeCAD (AKA 'HEAD' or the master branch) where many bugs are being removed (Hopefully! :wink:) and new features being woven in for testing and refinement.</p>
<p>It is the intention that there will be a post at the end of each month of FreeCAD development updates. Though that may seem a little ambitious, it may not be far from reality. For example, one of the core developers, Yorik Van Havre, creates a blog post on his <a class="reference external" href="http://yorik.uncreated.net/guestblog.php?tag=freecad">website</a> for his supporters every month with an update regarding his monthly FreeCAD hacking activities. So at the very least we'll figure out a way to link to his blog posts.</p>
<p>The main goal of the 0.18dev cycle is to iron out all Python3 and Qt5 incompatibilities.</p>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tracking Python3 and Qt5 compatibility is ongoing.

<li>An upgrade to the Start Page Workbench was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/1617">merged</a>. The UI has been modernized and updated with a Notepad that persists between FreeCAD sessions.</li>
<li>Arch Stair was improved see <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=29358">FreeCAD forum thread</a>

<li>Assembly3 port continues to receive a lot of attention and care for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/realthunder">@realthunder</a> and a lot of interest from the rest of the FreeCAD community. Progress of As3 can be followed on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/">git repo</a>

<li>Several Sketcher Solver refinements made it in to master, thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/abdullahtahiriyo">@abdullahtahiriyo</a>

</li>
<li>GSOC 2018 participant, @kkremitzki, completed his assignment of heroically maneuvering through the dependency hell that FreeCAD requires. Many upstream dependencies have been updated and are either pending or part of the upstream Debian package repositories which will make compiling FreeCAD more uniform across most *nix-based platforms.</li>

<p>This is the debut post for the FreeCAD Development Blog, which provides a unique
opportunity to bring the best FreeCAD development news and updates from the
community of developers and users.</p>
<p>The blog uses the Python-based <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> which provides an
intuitive command-line interface (see <tt class="docutils literal">nikola help</tt> after installation)
and consumes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html">reStructuredText</a> files.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://themes.getnikola.com/">Custom themes</a> are available, and standard CSS/JS
customization is possible as well. Nikola supports <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span> equation rendering.
It also has good multilingual support, key for FreeCAD's international community.
Nikola also comes with RSS support out of the box, so readers of this site can

for the blog source</a> and click the "Fork" button.
You can read about <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html">installing Nikola</a> or (assuming you have pip)
just run <tt class="docutils literal">sudo apt install <span class="pre">python3-pip</span> &amp;&amp; pip3 install <span class="pre">--user</span> <span class="pre">-U</span> nikola webassets ws4py watchdog</tt>. Then you need to clone your forked repository
by running:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/freecad-blog &amp;&amp; cd freecad-blog
$ nikola auto -b # Run autobuild and open an auto-refreshing browser window
$ nikola new_post # Follow the prompts and then edit posts/your_title.rst until satisfied
$ git add posts/your_title.rst # Begin the pull request process...
</pre>
<p>... and then finishing by making a pull request on the main repository using the commits you've
pushed to your fork.</p>
<p>Once the pull request is merged, anyone with write permission to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freecad/freecad.github.io">repository for built pages</a>
can then use <tt class="docutils literal">nikola build &amp;&amp; nikola deploy</tt> to build and deploy the new post.</p>
