<p>This is a daily updated log of the work I do on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/">BCF-plugin</a> for FreeCAD</p>
<p><strong>June 15th:</strong> <cite>writer.deleteElement()</cite> is not finished yet, work is still done
locally. On master <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/9f04faf2515be3b3b0f4d0c511864a7dd74a8bc7">commit 9f04faf</a> comprises some notable changes to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/bcf/writer.py">./src/bcf/writer.py</a>. Most notably is the renaming and enhancing of
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/writer.py#L279">writer.getContainingETElementForAttribute()</a> as well as the addition of new
testcases for this renamed function. But for more information please see the
commit message as it is quite elaborate.</p>
<p>The current state of <cite>writer.deleteElement()</cite> is that elements, whose types
inherit from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/interfaces/identifiable.py">interfaces.Identifiable</a>, can be deleted.</p>
<p>Additionally to the first two points I thought about how to handle modifications
of the data model. Should there be a separate function <cite>writer.modifyElement()</cite>
or could it also be constructed out of <cite>writer.deleteElement()</cite> and
<cite>writer.addElement()</cite>? Answer is: it could be constructed. But with the
implications that either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>every change is written instantaneously to disk and the data model stays
coherent with the bcf file. The disadvantag is that batchable updates are not
possible and it may use quite a lot of CPU time.</li>
<li>Or for every modification a snapshot of the data model is stored, with the
modified object in a list. This list is then processed chronological. This
preserves the possibility of issuing batched updates, but might use a
significant amount of memory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>June 14th:</strong> Today I finally finished the unit tests for
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/writer.py#L380">writer.addElement()</a>, for information on what it does please refer to the
function documentation as it is quite extensive and the function can handle
pretty much. The unit tests are to be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/tests/writer_tests.py">writer_tests.py</a>, and they were
finished in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/c0e43177fccd637b046f8e0645f3d856fce6b053">commit c0e4317</a>. Additionally to the unit tests this commit also
comprises refactorization of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/writer.py#L279">writer.getContainingETElementForAttribute()</a>,
a bugfix in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/writer.py#L230">writer.getInsertionIndex()</a>, a change in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/project.py#L68">project.SimpleList</a> and
the addition of <cite>getEtElement()</cite> in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/project.py#L29">project.SimpleElement</a>. But for more
information please refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/c0e43177fccd637b046f8e0645f3d856fce6b053">commit c0e4317</a>.</p>
<p>Then the second big commit is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a">commit 647b684</a>. In it I refactored the
assignment of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/interfaces/hierarchy.py#L9">Hierarchy.containingObject</a> member variable of classes
implementing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/interfaces/hierarchy.py">Hierarchy</a>. I moved it from the reader module to the individual
constructors which makes more sense, I think.</p>
<p>Currently I am starting my work on <cite>writer.deleteElement()</cite>.</p>
<p><strong>June 13th:</strong> All work today was done on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commits/unit_tests">branch unit_tests</a>. Today one
commit, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/24558c2a56c078d18b8f63b256ca5cc8ada7456e">commit 24558c2</a>, was added. In short: this commit adds two new test
cases and rewrites <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/writer.py#L230">writer.getInsertionIndex()</a>. The result of this function is
now the greatest index possible at which an element could be inserted. Now you
will also find yesterdays work in the commits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/2593bdb5a889e8ec4c531bd0e675c9ce65648eb5">commit 2593bdb</a>: <cite>writer.py: viewpoints can now be added</cite>
</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/4de50788af938d69f00fac01848ee7771d805ae1">commit 4de5078</a>: <cite>writer.py: compileChanges() function added</cite>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>June 12th:</strong> Viewpoint objects can now be added, resulting in the generation
of a new viewpoint file in the corresponding topic directory, for more
information please refere to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/2593bdb5a889e8ec4c531bd0e675c9ce65648eb5">commit 2593bdb</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/4de50788af938d69f00fac01848ee7771d805ae1">commit 4de5078</a> adds the
function <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/4de50788af938d69f00fac01848ee7771d805ae1/src/bcf/writer.py#L400">writer.compileChanges()</a>. It is not that long or complicated, but the
most stuff goes on under the hood of the function call in line
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/4de50788af938d69f00fac01848ee7771d805ae1/src/bcf/writer.py#L415">writer.compileChanges()#415</a>. It results in a depth first search objects that
don't are in the original state. Hence every data model class had to be edited.
Currently I am working locally on unit tests for the <cite>writer.addElement()</cite>
method for which I have 11 testcases planned. I will probably push them tomorrow
upstream.</p>
<p><strong>June 11th:</strong> with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/645a0f073c102ca82315e026b6a4c66f8b68faea">commit 645a0f0</a> I added support for all attributes that are
optional, to be added (at least the ones defined in <cite>markup.xsd</cite>). Currently I
am not supporting the addition of whole new projects, and viewpoints are not
mutable, so once after they are saved they stay. Then locally I am currently
implementing the addition of a whole viewpoint file. Probably tomorrow it will
be merged into master and pushed upstream.</p>
<p><strong>June 10th:</strong> <cite>writer.addElement()</cite> function is again further finished. It now
has the capability of adding attributes to <cite>File</cite> elements in the header. For
more information see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/da46aa438402fd7fe8be17d4ead232bc54ab6afe">commit da46aa4</a>, also <cite>markup.HeaderFile</cite> was added, for
more information please refere to the commit message. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/78ac6ce0eac8f3e9dedf6d2ab89f5f0d40430842">commit 78ac6ce</a>
introduces <cite>project.SimpleElement</cite>, <cite>project.SimpleList</cite> and
<cite>project.Attribute</cite>. They are used to represent the values of simple
elements, lists of simple elements or attribues respectively. But they also
inherit <cite>XMLName</cite>, <cite>Hierarchy</cite> and <cite>State</cite> so they can be treated like any other
representation of an element.</p>
<p><strong>June 9th:</strong> In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/2afab2ddd410761e864f73888085836b717c1820">commit 2afab2d</a> I implemented half of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/interfaces/xmlname.py">XMLName</a> interface
for all classes. This interface defines a property <cite>xmlName</cite> that each class
inherits. By default this property is set to the name of the class, but the
constructor of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/interfaces/xmlname.py">XMLName</a> also offers the possibility to define a custom name
(this is needed for the writer module). Second to the <cite>xmlName</cite> property it
defines a member function <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/3eeb7f8356ad664ad9ac40a31a7a1c58dfb74a16/src/interfaces/xmlname.py#L16">XMLName.getEtElement(element)</a> that shall receive an
<cite>xml.etree.ElementTree.Element</cite> object and shall extend it with its properties,
and return it again. It is expected that the returned element is schema conform
and can be inserted as it is.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/e0130434581c59e5ce490a078e1b262ddfd3c449">commit e013043</a> finally removed <cite>SchemaConstraint</cite> and its decendants, since
it was actually unnecessary.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/3eeb7f8356ad664ad9ac40a31a7a1c58dfb74a16">commit 3eeb7f8</a> added to the writer the functionality of adding objects of
type comment into the corresponding <cite>markup.bcf</cite> file.</p>
<p><strong>June 8th:</strong> I have worked on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/647b6845ae819e1175de2539e27ec42a08c45f1a/src/bcf/writer.py#L380">writer.addElement()</a> method. All work is
still local and not finished. The overall strategy for the writer module is to
read in the corresponding XML file using <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">xml.etree.ElementTree</a>, add the new
elements in this structure and write it to the file again.</p>
<p><strong>June 7th:</strong> Other than beginning a new blog post about the writer module and
how I envision it, I didn't come to much today.</p>
<p><strong>June 6th:</strong> Most work today was organisatorial: had correspondence with
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/teocomi">Matteo Cominetti</a> as well as with Paul Deckers (a Product Specialist at the
BIMcollab Support Team) about the topic of handling non conform schema files.
This topic bugs me! For the writer module I am starting to write, I started a
list that contains the elements that shall be updateable/addable and deleteable,
will be available in a future commit.
On to the development: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/d6c6cc5f69a1b179eebae8701e86e178146a02bb">commit d6c6cc5</a> I added an own class for the labels of
a topic. This class (<cite>Labels</cite>) inherits from list and also inherits the
<cite>Hierarchy</cite> interface, that I introduced yesterday. The initialisation of a
<cite>Topic</cite> object is unchanged, in the init function the list of string labels is passed
to the constructor of <cite>Labels</cite>. The inheritance from <cite>Hierarchy</cite> offers the
reader the possibility of easily generating the path that leads down to the
corresponding label element in the XML file.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/de38b48c9fcc200316741e85624b82275a99485b">commit de38b48</a> adds the parameter <cite>guid</cite> to the constructor of <cite>Comment</cite>.
Till today I overlooked it, which lead me to a pseudo problem. Without the Guid
of a comment I would have had the problem of uniquely identifying the comment
that shall be updated or deleted by the writer module. Additionally the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/de38b48c9fcc200316741e85624b82275a99485b">commit
de38b48</a> finishes the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/de38b48c9fcc200316741e85624b82275a99485b/src/bcf/writer.py#L61">writer.getUniqueIdOfListElementInHierarchy()</a> function
that generates the hierarchy of a given element and checks if it contains an
element that only occurs in a list, if that is the case then the unique id of
that list element is returned.</p>
<p><strong>June 5th:</strong> Today I finally followed the suggestion of @yorik and replaced my
own code for getting the path to the temporary folder with the python module
<cite>tempfiles</cite>, for more information see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/5616fd92e0a6e1d83cd99cae0ff85f7689ae0b99">commit 5616fd9</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/ac589c8fff50d9aa2ad63a70b92479277cd6cd38">commit ac589c8</a> is a
small one, but with some repercussions. In it I added <cite>_viewpoint</cite> to the
initialization sequence of the <cite>markup.__init__()</cite> function. Without it I
wouldn't have been able to use the property <cite>markup.viewpoint</cite>. The amount the
previous commit was smaller than usual <cite>commit c9f9ea4</cite> is larger. In it I
realized some conceptual stuff, like already implementing three interfaces in
many classes, that will make the writer module easier to write and more
maintainable. For this I added the <cite>./src/interfaces</cite> folder. It is its own
python package, and defines three modules/interfaces (atm):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>State: represents the state of an object during the plugin lifetime</li>
<li>Hierarchy: allows an object to know the object it is part of and thereby
somewhat implementing a doubly linked tree. For example consider an object
of <cite>Markup</cite>. It probably has one or more objects of type <cite>Comment</cite>. Now each
comment has a member <cite>containingObject</cite>, which in this case references the
one object of type <cite>Markup</cite> that references it.</li>
<li>Identifiable: allows an object to define a unique Id, if it shall be
uniquely identifiable. This is intended to be used mainly for objects that
can occur multiple times. Like for example <cite>Viewpoint</cite>. Here the Id is the
id defined in the XML file.</li>
</ul>
<p>But please refer to the commit itself for more information, as it has a rather
extensive commit message, describing the interfaces in more detail.</p>
<p>Please note: tomorrow I won't be able to do much. I try to throw in between one
and three hours.</p>
<p><strong>June 4th:</strong> In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/0557bcc4eddf1175393fc26cd0526e8d0d3d55b9">commit 0557bcc</a> I fixed the issue where the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/9ecb6b1009521a147cc87bf3a37bceb905ca7f22/src/bcf/markup.py#L106">Comment</a> s didn't
have a valid <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/9ecb6b1009521a147cc87bf3a37bceb905ca7f22/src/bcf/markup.py#L43">ViewpointReference</a> object after creation. The member
<cite>Comment.viewpoint</cite> should, after creation, hold a reference to a valid
<cite>ViewpointReference</cite> object that was created in <cite>reader.buildMarkup()</cite>. Actually it was not
implemented till today, I just left a TODO note for me.
In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/354d2c46cfcf0fc3ee0c97832447b4bc370a9cbf">commit 354d2c4</a> I added new testcases, all for testing the results of
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/9ecb6b1009521a147cc87bf3a37bceb905ca7f22/src/bcf/reader.py#L528">reader.buildViewpoint()</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/0733b591b3a0871c68bd4e13c72bf80d4ccc986e">commit 0733b59</a> includes fixes of bugs I became
aware of during testing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/9ecb6b1009521a147cc87bf3a37bceb905ca7f22/src/bcf/reader.py#L528">reader.buildViewpoint()</a>, as well as the
implementation of <cite>__str__()</cite> for some more classes, which helped during
debugging. Then <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/d6cb41c06bf1eb77f4fdd42782e4a61fd4a1a1fd">commit d6cb41c</a> also contains bug fixes and debug prints were
remove, but see more in the commit message. And finally I added the file
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/bcf/writer.py">./src/bcf/writer.py</a> with some dictionaries that I will need for the writer
module.</p>
<p>Last but not least one thing I learned today using git: don't rebase onto
master. Rebase master onto some branches but not the other way around. This
makes things messy.</p>
<p><strong>June 3rd:</strong> A new blog post is ready, this one elaborates a bit on the ideas I
have in regards to handling <a class="reference external" href="posts/handling-non-conform-bcf-files/">non schema conform BCF files</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commits/unit_tests">branch unit_tests</a>
got a few new commits, mainly adding test cases for the <cite>reader.buildTopic()</cite>
and <cite>reader.buildComment()</cite> functions, for more info see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/c94d812af69e05cc0128b32038ab2e01927afeb0">commit c94d812</a>.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/7a31462cb37e0cc94eebeda8a02af4641ab42ca6">commit 7a31462</a> contains bug fixes for bugs that I became aware of due to the
newly created test cases. Offline I thought for an extended period of time about
how to structure an update in place approach to writing the bcf file, rather
than writing the whole file at once. For this a new blog post is coming this
week.</p>
<p><strong>June 2nd:</strong> I have written on a blog post about how to handle non XSD conform
BCF files (which is not finished, yet). Otherwise I paused development.
Tomorrow it is gonna be picked up again!</p>
<p><strong>June 1st:</strong> Today not much work was done, but here is a little summary. I
implemented the <cite>__eq__()</cite> function in every class I defined, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/03057542226fde14de0bf312e032ec4e41d23a4b">commit
0305754</a>. This shall help me in the future when I want to write unit tests.
In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/bcf/reader.py">reader.py</a> I inserted a rather long comment about how the <cite>buildX</cite>
functions, like what they do, what they expect and what they return. Since all
behave the same I have written one big comment to document all of them, but see
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/a05e22b45d3ff86871d5ac14e355cf25e4b45596">commit a05e22b</a>. The branch <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commits/feature_read_viewpoint">feature_read_viewpoint</a> got merged into master,
for testing I will create a own testing branch. And I created a package out of
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/tree/master/src/bcf">src/bcf</a> directory that just exports <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/bcf/reader.py">reader.py</a> and <cite>writer.py</cite> (latter
one I still have to write), for details see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/015c2f6fc162b6dbe15a9c3bc8957679935dd1a6">commit 015c2f6</a>.</p>
<p><strong>May 31st:</strong> Today all work was done on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commits/feature_read_viewpoint">feature_read_viewpoint</a>-branch.
Most important the function <cite>reader.buildViewpoint()</cite> is finished and with it
the last step was completed to being able to read in a complete BCF file, given
it is validated successful against the XML schemas. For more info see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/2922d71af78845bfbdb05ac571c232cfcfdd5989">commit
2922d71</a>. To test the reader "module" I created two new topics in
<cite>src/bcf/test_data</cite>. One is complete in the way that it defines at least one
element for every node in all files specified by the corresponding XSD file. The
third topic just has a complete header element in <cite>markup.bcf</cite>. For more info
see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/7fa127aec6847d9bd653fe43f345b7ee4eaa992b">commit 7fa127a</a>. Now ViewpointReference has a reference to the
corresponding Viewpoint object. The inheritance approach thrown away because
after reading in all ViewpointReferences from <cite>markup.bcf</cite> the Viewpoint objects
would have been created, but with no relation to their super class. This meant
that an object of the former could not have been used as an object of the latter
without recreation of this object. That further would have complicated the code,
and made it hard to understand and maintain. Therefore composition was chosen in
favor of inheritance. For more info also see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/2922d71af78845bfbdb05ac571c232cfcfdd5989">commit 2922d71</a>.</p>
<p><strong>May 30th:</strong> Added the folder <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/tree/master/src/bcf/test_data">src/bcf/test_data</a> that is intended to contain
test data for testing during development, but not primarily for unit tests now.
Currently it contains an example compliant with the schema files. For more info
see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/6fb72f5bbefddc0a063f67c4d6fa806b68763ee2">commit 6fb72f5</a>. In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/30b998d12ce4c647abc26a6e42a9a5f0efd872fd">commit 30b998d</a> I changed the type of every variable
associated with <cite>SchemaConstraints</cite> to an elementary type. Reason being that the
<cite>extensions.xsd</cite> file (as my understanding goes) is intended to be specified
in the xml file itself as ... well, an extension to the existing schema.
Finished function <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/3f5fdafb09422e0be0fb10f59f1df76619b2a3ea/src/bcf/reader.py#L350">reader.buildMarkup()</a>, although still a "#TODO" comment is
above the function header. Also in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/aa045980b5f2391b7d93dbf2caa163c6f7f8acac">commit aa04598</a> the class
<cite>DocumentReference</cite> and <cite>BimSnippet</cite> was added. Last but not least: started
working on reading in <cite>viewpoint.bcfv</cite>. But not finished, that is why this
development is still on the branch <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commits/feature_read_viewpoint">feature_read_viewpoint</a>. For more info

<p><strong>May 29th:</strong> Already started refactoring a bit in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/blob/master/src/bcf/reader.py">reader.py</a>. Went away from
using <cite>ZipFile</cite> objects when operating on the zipFile to the extracted version
of the zip file instead. Written function <cite>reader.readInFile()</cite> that shall read
the complete BCF file into the data structure (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/commit/9a791627b16b09e9c6641975e6fb0a9bf7e72856">commit 9a79162</a>). During testing
I noticed that the example BCF file from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bimcollab.com/en/Support/Support/Downloads/Examples-templates">bimcollab website</a> is not valid
becaus it defines an empty node <cite>Header</cite> in <cite>markup.bcf</cite> of topic
<cite>ebb1a8bf-6d1d-4aad-a875-61ad3cc40d30</cite> which is prohibited by <cite>markup.xsd</cite> of
BCF version 2.1.</p>
<p><strong>May 28th:</strong> Created a new blog post about the way the schema constraints are
handled now (<a class="reference external" href="posts/schema-constraints-revisited/">schema constraints revisited</a>). Change configuration file of the
blog to reflect the current project, instead of the FreeCAD development blog.
Started a unit-test suite, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/tree/unit_tests/src/tests">branch unit_tests ./src/tests</a>, and test cases

<p>Wait would you write files with the intention that they don't conform to the
provided XSD files? ... you might ask by just reading the title. No I wouldn't.
As I introduced in my last blog post (<a class="reference external" href="posts/handling-non-conform-bcf-files/">Handling Non-Conform BCF Files</a>), that
was not an update of the dev-logs post, I introduced the need of supporting
files from vendors that might do some things differently. I ended this last post
with a pros and cons list about two approaches that I thought of. In the
meantime I decided for latter one.</p>
<div class="section" id="recap">
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>The second approach, let's call it update approach, extracts the BCF file to a
temporary folder, reads the contents into memory (that are conform to the
corresponding XSD file) and every time the state in
memory is changed the updates get written to the dicrectory structure in the
temporary folder. At the end, when the plugin is closed and its lifetime ends,
this directory is compressed again and stored in its original location. The
update approach thereby does not alter any data that the plugin didn't load into
memory, it works "around" it.</p>
<p>I think this is the better appraoch, since no exceptions to the rule have to be
made for every speciality that a vendor might incorporate in its files. However,
the writer module has to have an understanding of XML baked in, in order for it
to be able to update these files in place.</p>
<p>In the next section I want to elaborate a bit more on how I envision this writer
module.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-actual-stuff">
<h2>Writing actual stuff</h2>
<p>At the beginning of every writing operation it has to be known whether an
existing element shall be modified, a new element shall be added or an existing
one shall be deleted. Following you will find my thoughts, uncompiled, as I have
written them down onto paper. First will be the handling of additions.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<div class="section" id="how-can-additions-be-handled">
<h3>How can additions be handled?</h3>
<p>Every element class (a class that directly represents a XML-Element like
<cite>Comment</cite>) shall have a function that returns the XML-Text. This text is then
going to be inserted at the right place by the writer module.
The writer module has to crawl through the complete data model to check/compile
a list of objects that were added, changed or deleted. Then for each added
object it calls the XML-Text function to get the corresponding XML-text for each
element. A second function shall give the following information about the
position at which it should be inserted (could also be done with a dictionary,
that way the data model stays clean):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the containing element: the containing element of <cite>Comment</cite> is <cite>Markup</cite>
</li>
<li>the relatie order: a list of elements that preceed the current one in
reverse order. So the immediate predecessor is first in the list. The last
element of the list is the containing element.</li>
<li>if the new element shall be added inside an element that might occur more than
once (e.g.: <cite>ModifiedDate</cite> in <cite>Comment</cite>) then also a unique id of that list
element has to be retrieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The writer then searches for the containing element in the file and then goes
through the contents of the containing element, searching for the one with the
least index in the relative order list. The text is inserted right after the
closing tag of the chosen element.</p>
<p>Any references should not be handled/checked in the writer module (e.g.: that
the viewpoint guid in the to be written comment object belongs to an actual
existing viewpoint). Such consistency checks are assumed to be handled in the
GUI or the programmatic interface respectively.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils">
<div class="section" id="how-can-updates-be-handled">
<h3>How can updates be handled?</h3>
<p>An element either has to occur only once in the corresponding file, or be
identified uniquely by some attribute. Without one of these two constraints the
identification of the right element in the XML-file becomes extremely hard or
cannot be done deterministically.
An object shall be flagged <cite>MODIFIED</cite> iff (=if and only if) a non-list child
element was changed. A change of a list element translates either to an addition
or deletion, or a change of an element that can be identified
deterministically, as described above. In which case the object, containing the
list with one or more items changed, shall not be flagged <cite>MODIFIED</cite>. Each
object shall then contain a list of changed objects, oblivious of whether it
translates to an attribute or element. for each of these objects the writer
module has to gather following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>element hierarchy: <cite>ModifiedDate</cite> in <cite>Comment</cite> would have
<cite>ModifiedDate</cite> -&gt; <cite>Comment</cite> -&gt; <cite>Markup</cite> as hierarchy list.</li>
<li>unique id of every list element that is in the hierarchy (like with additions)</li>
<li>whether it translates to an attribute or an element</li>
</ul>
<p>The writing module shall collect a list of all elements that are flagged
<cite>MODIFIED</cite>. For each element the writer module shall collect the amount
information listed above. It then follows the element hierarchy of the object in
reverse order till it reaches the changed object itself. At this point the
distinction between attribute and element has to be made. For both cases the
following two steps happen:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the respective substring of the element has to be found and</li>
<li>be replaced entirely by the XML-text generated from the object</li>
</ol>
</div>
<hr class="docutils">
<div class="section" id="how-can-deletions-be-handled">
<h3>How can deletions be handled?</h3>
<p>The writer module compiles a list of all elements to delete. For each element
the following information shall be gathered:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>which file is the element contained in</li>
<li>unique id of the element (if available)</li>
<li>name of the element</li>
</ul>
<p>The writer module then searches for the unique id in the specified file that
also matches the element name and deletes it from the start to the end tag.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils">
<div class="section" id="how-shall-the-interface-to-the-writer-look">
<h2>How shall the interface to the writer look?</h2>
<p>The above mentioned crawler has the advantage of alos supporting writing the
file only once. Therefore also being somewhat resource saving.
The writer shall have a function <cite>writeChanges()</cite>. This function receives an
object of type <cite>project</cite> which denotes the starting point of the search. Every
object shall have a variable of enum type. This variable is allowed to take on
one of the following four values:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ORIGINAL</li>
<li>MODIFIED</li>
<li>ADDED</li>
<li>DELETED</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these states the writer maintains a separate list. Each state has to
be handled differenty during writing. It shall also be possible for the user to
just issue an update of all of these four lists and then subsequently manually
decides the point in time when updates shall be written.
=&gt; <cite>updatechangdLists()</cite> -&gt; <cite>writeChanges()</cite>. Since <cite>writeChanges()</cite> now has to
fulfill two functions: once triggering <cite>updateChangedLists()</cite> and the other time
just take these lists as they are, its argument shall be optional.
For an addition, deletion, update it is important to know in which folder the
to-update file is stored. For this a get topic function shall be implemented.</p>

<p>This post shall just collect some ideas I had about handling BCF files whose
contents may not be (in part) conform to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Schemas">XSDs</a> supplied by buildingSmart on
github.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-is-there-a-need-for-that">
<h2>Why is there a need for that?</h2>
<p>Well, during testing with one of the two BCF files I currently have (here the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.bimcollab.com/Files/Example-Projects/BIMcollab_Example_project_Issues-bcfzip.aspx">link to the first one</a> to download) I wanted to validate each file I read in,
before I read it in, to be (mostly) sure that my code does not throw unexpected
exceptions. But already in <cite>markup.bcf</cite> of the first topic the library I use,
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/">xmlschema</a>, threw an <cite>XMLSchemaValidatorError</cite>. The reason was that the node
<cite>&lt;Header /&gt;</cite> was defined, but it was defined empty, which is prohibited by
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/blob/master/Schemas/markup.xsd">markup.xsd</a>. So as quick fix I deleted the <cite>&lt;Header /&gt;</cite> node altogether to be
able to test my code somewhat. But now on to the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-xmlschema-report-parsing-errors">
<h2>How does <cite>xmlschema</cite> report parsing errors?</h2>
<p>Before we can go into the problem solution, a little investigation of the
library I am using has to be done. We need to know how it handles the nodes and
attributes that could not be parsed/decoded against the corresponding XSD
file.
For parsing/decoding <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/">xmlschema</a> defines the following three <a class="reference external" href="https://xmlschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#xsd-validation-modes">validation
modes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>strict</strong>: Schemas are validated against the meta-schema. The processor stops
when an error is found in a schema or during the validation/decode of XML
data.</p>
<p><strong>lax</strong>: Schemas are validated against the meta-schema. The processor collects
the errors and continues, eventually replacing missing parts with wildcards.
Undecodable XML data are replaced with None.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Schemas are not validated against the meta-schema. The processor
doesn't collect any error. Undecodable XML data are replaced with the original
text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the ones, like me, that got confused by the first sentence of the first two modes:
every schema that is read in is itself validated against a schema, the
meta-schema, before it can be used. These modes can be used separately for
reading the schema file and for parsing/decoding a XML file. So for example it
is possible to read the <cite>markup.xsd</cite> in <strong>strict</strong> mode, thereby validating it
against a meta-schema, but then parsing/decoding the <cite>markup.bcf</cite> file in
<strong>lax</strong> or <strong>skip</strong> mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-what-way-can-errors-be-handled">
<h2>In what way can errors be handled?</h2>
<p>Given the modes in which XML files can be read in by <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/">xmlschema</a> I could only
think about the following two possibilities on how to handle possible errors:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Just ignore the node that could not be parsed/decoded against the
corresponding schema file. Easy to accomplish with <strong>lax</strong> mode.</li>
<li>Read in the plain XML text for that node, store it somewhere in the data
structure and when writing it all out again just insert the plain XML text into
the right place. Only possible in <strong>skip</strong> mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main drawback of number 1 is clearly that the data, that couldn't be read
in, would be lost, or only exist in an earlier version of the BCF file, after
the datastructure got written. It would certainly be easy to implement but does
not offer the user great value if his or her data get lost. This is, however, on
the premise of reading in the file once and writing it once after all changes
have been made in memory.</p>
<p>The second option offers a possibility to circumvent the lost data problem. The
not-parsable elements just get read in plain.</p>
<p>But there may be another option that could use <strong>lax</strong> mode without the data
loss. This option is another approach to writing the contents of the
datastructure to the file. Originally I planned to do it in one sweep when the
user presses the enter key or the save button for that matter.  But then
<a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=255">hardeeprai</a> from the <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/">freecad forum</a> suggested, to another topic, that I
write changes right after the were made. So effectively implementing an update
driven approach to making changes permanent.</p>
<p>So now there are two possible approaches to handling errors that each use a
different validation mode. In the next section I want to list some thoughts I
came up with for each one of these approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="approaches-pros-cons">
<h2>Approaches: Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
<div class="section" id="reading-once-and-writing-once">
<h3>Reading once and writing once</h3>
<p>As already established, <strong>skip</strong> mode must be used here with <cite>xmlschema</cite>. For
every member in the data structure it has to be noted somewhere if it could be
read in or not. That would indicate whether the node holds the acutal value of
the intended datatype or if it holds the plain XML text as string.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> writing the datastructure is fairly easy</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage #1:</strong> every class, that represents part of the XML file, has to be
changed in order to house the additional information about every member or a
whole new datastructure has to be created for that.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage #2:</strong> the type annotations become invalid, if this approach is
used, which leads to confusion by the ones reading the code.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage #3:</strong> the module that reads in the XML file into the data model
becomes much more complex, thereby not aiding the understandability of the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-the-file-on-the-fly">
<h3>Updating the file on the fly</h3>
<p>Here <strong>lax</strong> mode can be used with <cite>xmlschema</cite>. Still the whole file has to be
read in once, but the parts that could not be parsed/decoded stay in the file and are
not read in. To really be able to update the original file, the datamodel has to
accommodate information for every element if it is new or updated, and therefore
shall be written or not. The overhead here is comparable to the first approach
but every class just needs one additional member to signify a change or that
this object was newly created.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage #1:</strong> (as already mentioned) not so much overhead in the data model
compared to the first approach.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage #2:</strong> The user is not exposed to the danger of losing unsaved
changes, since it is updated every time a new change is committed to the data
representation.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage #1:</strong> the module that writes the data to the BCF file has to have
light parsing capabilities or a XML awareness respectively, in order to be able
to edit XML files directly. This does not have to be the case with the first
approach, since we could utilize the <cite>xmlschema</cite> library.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage #2:</strong> Objects that get deleted must not be deleted right away
from the data model. Rather a flag has to be set that it is "deleted" and the
corresponding part in the file has to be removed as well. After that it can be
removed from the data model.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>I am gravitating more to the latter option, since it does not interfere with the
type annotations, and therefore does not complicate the whole type situation
in the data model. What I still have to face, however, is the XML aware writer
module. This is going to be fun!</p>

    <div>
<p>In an <a class="reference external" href="posts/how-to-represent-extensionxsd-constraints/">older post</a>, one or two weeks back, I've written about a design issue I was
facing when trying to integrate the constraints of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/blob/release_2_1/Extension%20Schemas/extensions.xsd">extensions.xsd</a> into my
class model. <cite>extension.xsd</cite> defines possible values for the XML nodes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TopicType</li>
<li>TopicLabel</li>
<li>TopicStatus</li>
<li>SnippetType</li>
<li>Priority</li>
<li>Stage</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to ensure that the variables, representing let's say <cite>TopicType</cite>, can
only assume valid values, as defined in <cite>extension.xsd</cite>.  My first idea was to
just define <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html">Enums</a> following the schema. Generally this idea is fine but it
doesn't do so well with version changes. A new version of the BCF-XML standard
would then possibly require more maintenance work than necessary. My aim with
this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD">BCF plugin for FreeCAD</a> is it to create a data model that requires as
little maintenance work as possible, although the code still has to be adapted
to support any new version.</p>
<p>From the maintenance point of view hardcoded enumerations were not really an option.</p>
<p>The next idea was to create something like dynamic enumerations. These would
have the advantage that the constraint is enforced (i.e.: a variable holding an
enumeration value can only hold a valid value as defined in the enumeration
itself). I knew it was possible to change a class object (not the object <em>of</em> a
class) during runtime and add or remove members from it.  I thought maybe this
is also possible with classes that derive from <cite>Enum</cite>. In python to create an
enumeration you just have to define a class like this:</p>
<pre class="code python"><a name="rest_code_28961d1f373348e78c69c7d9b79bcb1e-1"></a><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">enum</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Enum</span>
<a name="rest_code_28961d1f373348e78c69c7d9b79bcb1e-2"></a>
<a name="rest_code_28961d1f373348e78c69c7d9b79bcb1e-3"></a><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Example</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">):</span>
<a name="rest_code_28961d1f373348e78c69c7d9b79bcb1e-4"></a>  <span class="n">VAL1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<a name="rest_code_28961d1f373348e78c69c7d9b79bcb1e-5"></a>  <span class="n">VAL2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<a name="rest_code_28961d1f373348e78c69c7d9b79bcb1e-6"></a>  <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
<p>The first obstacle was that classes can only derive from a class (that itself
derives from <cite>Enum</cite>) iff they don't introduce new members. Otherwise this would
break some invariants the python interpreter has over enumerations.
The second obstacle was a logical implication of the first: if subclasses
couldn't add new members to an enum-super-class then it is also not possible to
add new members to enumerations during runtime.</p>
<p>So another solution had to be thought of. I maintained the basic structure I
had envisioned for the dynamic enumeration solution. Namely one superclass
called <cite>SchemaConstraint</cite> and one subclass for each of the above mentioned XML
nodes. Every piece of code that wants to represent one of these XML nodes would
store an object of one of the subclasses in a variable of type <cite>SchemaConstraint</cite>.
The actual value of the object is stored in a class variable, <cite>value</cite>, that
holds just any value of type string. This approach of course has the downside that
basically any value can be assigned to the variable <cite>value</cite>, if not restricted.
In order to change this I made the class variable <cite>value</cite> a property where the
setter checks whether the new value is actually a valid value.</p>
<p>Now the question arises: How does the setter function know which value is valid?
Every node has different valid values!</p>
<p>To solve this issue I introduced, for one, the list <cite>validValues</cite> into
<cite>SchemaConstraints</cite> (<cite>value</cite> does also reside there) and, for the other, a
static function called <cite>parseConstraints(elementName)</cite>. This static function
reads the valid values for the XML node <cite>elementName</cite> from <cite>extension.xsd</cite> and
returns them as list.  <cite>parseConstraints()</cite> is intended to be called from the
<cite>__init__()</cite> function of each one of the sub classes (e.g.:
<cite>TopicType.__init__()</cite>). To make things clearer I put a small code example below
showing the classes <cite>SchemaConstraints</cite> and <cite>TopicType</cite> as well as all the
members of both classes.</p>

<p>One important thing to note here is that the setter method of <cite>validValues</cite> has
just one line which contains <cite>pass</cite>. This is done in order to ensure that the
set of valid values does not get overwritten, at least not that easily.</p>
<p>This solution has, for one, the advantage of being adaptable, in case new values
get added to the list of valid values and, for the other, through the setter function of <cite>value</cite>
it can be enforced that the state of an object is always valid.</p>

<p>The main takeaway from the XML Schema Definition Tutorial I went through today
was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
So the node <cite>&lt;xs:sequence&gt;...&lt;/xs:sequence&gt;</cite> is part of the definition of a
complex type, it is also called an indicator. What it does is that it tells the
XML checker that the elements specified inside have to occur in the same order
in the XML document to be valid. Also it specifies what elements may be
contained in the complex node.</blockquote>
<p>This greatly improved my understanding of <cite>visinfo.xsd</cite> which describes how a
<cite>viewpoint.bcfv</cite> file is built. As I learned during design, the representation
of a viewpoint is almost as complex as the representation of the remaining
contents of a BCF file.</p>
<p>I thought about how I coudl read the contents of a BCF into this file structure.
As my brain always does, it thinks through the whole process, from checking if
the given file is valid till the point where all the data resides in an object
in memory. This makes me prone to "reinventing the wheel" as I also design a XSD
parser/checker in my head which I then would use to check the given files before
reading them in. But a quick google search brought up a better option, namely an
offical <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/">python library</a> for checking XML files against a schema.</p>
<p>Last but not least: I am pleased to announce that the first draft of the class
diagram is ready. You can find it <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/tree/master/doc">here</a> if you are interested.</p>

<p>In the <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=308095#p308095">forum post</a> yesterday, Yorik pointed out that, although part of the
specification, the BimSnippet does not have to be treated with high priority. He
also referred me to Bernd and Duncan in case of questions arising.
As advised, I will consider the BimSnippet in the data model but probably won't
implement it right away.</p>
<p>The progress I made today was mostly in understanding the BCF specification in
regards to the viewpoint.bcfv file. Multiple viewpoint files can be contained
within the folder of one topic. At the beginning of the day I thought that the
data model would be finished rather quick but as it turned out the documentation
on it is not as concise as one might wish it to be. To be more precise: the
whole section about the "Components" element is a bit confusing. It lists
multiple "properties", like <cite>Selection</cite> and <cite>Visibility</cite>. My intuition says that
<cite>Selection</cite> contains a list of components that are selected, and <cite>Visibility</cite>
specifies whether these components shall be visible or not. But in reality each
contains a list of components onto which the values of the attributes of the
respective property shall be applied.</p>
<p>This is a bit confusing at first, and still is for me. Because of this ambiguity
I decided, for the further data model design, that refer to the related XML
schemas rather than the written documentation. For example here you can find the
schema for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/blob/master/Schemas/visinfo.xsd">viewpoint.bcf</a> file.</p>
<p>But since the last time I have worked with XML schemas was in vocational school
(I think 2012) I have to refresh my memory on it. For that I will go through the
relevant parts of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp">W3CSchools: XML Schema Tutorial</a>. Tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today I mostly finished the UML class diagram in regard to representing the data
of the <tt class="docutils literal">markup.bcf</tt> file. One think I found kind of interesing while creating
the diagram is that in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Documentation">BCF-XML-Documentation</a> There is no link between a
topic and a comment, so no id of one is stored in the other. That didn't make
sense at first because I thought that one <tt class="docutils literal">markup</tt> could have multiple topics,
which is <strong>not</strong> the case.</p>
<p>However one think what is not that obvious to me is the case with the <tt class="docutils literal">BIMSnippet</tt>.
On the documentation page it says that: "BimSnippet is an additional file containing
information related to one or multiple topics.". This would imply that there
would be more topics inside one <tt class="docutils literal">markup.bcf</tt> file, because <tt class="docutils literal">BimSnippet</tt> is,
as I understand, also just a node inside <tt class="docutils literal">markup.bcf</tt>.</p>
<p>Regarding the open question from the previous post: How to represent constraints
defined in <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>; I thought about it a little today and came to the
conclusion that it would be the best approach to go with the last option I
listed. That means that for every node, for which constraints are listed in
<tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>, an empty enumeration/class is created which then, during
runtime, gets populated with the valid values.</p>
<p>UPDATE (2019-05-13): The inconsistency is resolved. The BimSnippet node just references one
file that does not have to be inside the topic folder.</p>

<p>So by now this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD">repository</a> exists, which already houses two example BCF files in
<tt class="docutils literal">examples/</tt>,
supplied by <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=68">yorik</a>. This repository is intended to be the main development repository.
I started a little UML class diagram, which you can find in
the folder <tt class="docutils literal">doc/</tt> in the root directory of the repository.</p>
<p>Note however, the class "Template" is just used for copy and paste. I used it to
set the font to Sourcecode Pro, which was kind of tedious, and since I didn't
know if these font changes translate to newly created classes too I have gone
with the copy&amp;paste approach. The classes presented in this diagram are all for
representing the data from the markup.bcf file (except for the class "Project").
For the creation of these class diagrams I use <a class="reference external" href="http://dia-installer.de/download/linux.html.de">Dia</a>.</p>
<p>The current problem I am facing is: how to represent the constraints given in
the <tt class="docutils literal">extension.xsd</tt> file (a link to it <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-XML/tree/master/Extension%20Schemas">here</a>). The most constraints listed in
this file are just listings of valid values for some nodes or attributes. What I
want to do is to force the user of this classes to use one of the valid values
and not have to implement extra code that checks each time the value is set or
written to a file for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>So what possibilities do I have to choose from?</strong></p>
<p>Probably most intuitively would be to create one enumeration class (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html">python
reference</a>) for each attibute or node listed in <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>. The main
disadvantage her ist that these enumerations have to be maintained by hand, in
the case of a change to <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt>. That makes this first intuitive
option quite unattractive.</p>
<p>The second option that comes to mind would be to parse <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt> and
then programmatically define the enumerations. This is possible due to the
dynamically typed nature of python. However this also implies that the classes,
containing a representation of an affected attribute or node, also have to be
modified every time the plugin starts and <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt> is parsed. This is
because the classes, of which type the class variables are, do not exist before
runtime.</p>
<p>A third approach would also be possible where one enumeration class is written,
before runtime, with no values. Then during startup <tt class="docutils literal">extensions.xsd</tt> gets
parsed and the valid values are added to the enumerations. That however has one
drawback: if the standard gets updated, and a new constraint is put upon another
field then an according class would have to be created manually.</p>
<p>In the end I still have to think about how it is done best, and what is the most
maintainable version. Already I tend to latter option, because when the standard
changes, most probably also the implementation of this plugin has to change.</p>
